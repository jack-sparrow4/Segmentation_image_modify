# Image Segmentation and Effects Application

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that uses the MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation module to segment the foreground from the background in an image. It allows users to upload an image, apply various effects, and modify the background in different ways.

## Features

- **Image Segmentation**: Automatically segment the foreground of an image using MediaPipe's Selfie Segmentation.
- **Custom Backgrounds**: Upload a custom background to replace the original background.
- **Image Effects**:
  - **Grayscale**: Convert the background to grayscale while keeping the foreground untouched.
  - **Replace**: Replace the original background with a user-uploaded image.
  - **Replace with Grayscale**: Replace the background with a grayscale version of a user-uploaded image.
  - **Blur**: Blur the background while keeping the foreground sharp.
  - **Blur with Grayscale**: Apply both blur and grayscale effects to the background.
- **Adjustable Segmentation Threshold**: Fine-tune the threshold to control the sensitivity of the segmentation.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jack-sparrow4/Segmentation_image_modify.git
   cd image-segmentation-app
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   Create a virtual environment and install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Upload an image**: 
   - Click the "Browse files" button on the sidebar to upload an image (`.jpg`, `.png`, or `.jpeg` formats).
   - Optionally, you can upload a background image if you want to replace the original background.

5. **Choose an effect**: 
   - Select an effect from the dropdown menu on the sidebar (`gray`, `replace`, `replace_gray`, `blur`, or `blur_gray`).
   
6. **Adjust the segmentation threshold**:
   - Use the slider to fine-tune the threshold to achieve better segmentation results.

7. **View the result**:
   - The original image and processed image with the selected effect will be displayed side by side.

## Dependencies

The application uses the following Python libraries:

- `streamlit`: For building the interactive web interface.
- `opencv-python (cv2)`: For image processing operations.
- `mediapipe`: For the selfie segmentation module.
- `numpy`: For array manipulations.
- `Pillow (PIL)`: For handling image file formats in Python.

Install the dependencies via `pip` by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Acknowledgments

- This application uses the [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev) Selfie Segmentation module for image segmentation.
- Thanks to the open-source community for making tools like Streamlit and OpenCV available for use.
